wall that you clip into, you bring gear that you set into holes and cracks in the wall, and then clip into that, so they can have a tendency to come out if you fall and they were set wrong, also you have to conscience of when you need to set the next piece because you don't want to run out of one size that let's say you needed more of at the top, or maybe you think \"oh my last piece is close enough, i don't need to put one here\" but then there isn't another good spot to put one for a long while"},{"user":"Michael Bird","date":"2011-09-17T03:32:00.000Z","text":"there's a lot more that

Bird","date":"2011-11-22T06:19:00.000Z","text":"dude why can't i find anything good on header files for c"},{"user":"Michael Bird","date":"2011-11-22T06:20:00.000Z","text":"because what i used to think about them is turning out not quite right"},{"user":"Michael Bird","date":"2011-11-22T06:20:00.000Z","text":"i thought it was what i'm now assuming libraries actually are"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:21:00.000Z","text":"they just tell a program what to load from a library"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:22:00.000Z","text":"so, the library holds the actual function definition, and when you put it in the header, the program now knows it needs to look through its library for that function because it will be called"},{"user":"Michael Bird","date":"2011-11-22T06:24:00.000Z","text":"well ok so if i make my own header file, i import it via #import \"myheader.h\""},{"user":"Michael Bird","date":"2011-11-22T06:25:00.000Z","text":"but for normal stuff you say #import <stdio.h>"},{"user":"Michael Bird","date":"2011-11-22T06:25:00.000Z","text":"why the difference with < or \""},{"user":"David

Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:26:00.000Z","text":"it just differs in where you're telling the preprocessor to look for the file"},{"user":"Michael Bird","date":"2011-11-22T06:26:00.000Z","text":"so \" is for a local header"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:27:00.000Z","text":"right"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:27:00.000Z","text":"< this will go into your system

the standard ones like stdio.h only contain the function declarations or is the full definition of the function written there?"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:31:00.000Z","text":"it could have the actual definitions there, i'm not sure"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:31:00.000Z","text":"you can always open them up"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:32:00.000Z","text":"i just open mine and it's just function definnitions"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:32:00.000Z","text":"i mean declarations"},{"user":"Michael Bird","date":"2011-11-22T06:33:00.000Z","text":"mine's garble-de-goop"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:34:00.000Z","text":"you opened it with

libraries based on the code written there?"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:37:00.000Z","text":"yeah, and it also has alot of information about the functions and even defines some constants"},{"user":"Michael Bird","date":"2011-11-22T06:39:00.000Z","text":"i feel like i was taught 5% of c"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:39:00.000Z","text":"we are taught practical C"},{"user":"Michael Bird","date":"2011-11-22T06:39:00.000Z","text":"and i feel like with java i'm getting taught soooooo much more of the things it can do in comparison"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:40:00.000Z","text":"i don't think it was that way for me"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:41:00.000Z","text":"i was just taught the nature of object oriented programming, but there are deeper things about java that are improvements to C that i still know nothing about"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:41:00.000Z","text":"like it's object heirarchy, or how garbage collection works"},{"user":"Michael Bird","date":"2011-11-22T06:42:00.000Z","text":"i don't know if i know much about garbage collection but object heirarchy is like the main thing we are learing"},{"user":"Michael Bird","date":"2011-11-22T06:43:00.000Z","text":"did you learn about abstract classes and extends and interfaces?"},{"user":"David

object is subclass of another object interally"},{"user":"Michael Bird","date":"2011-11-22T06:45:00.000Z","text":"via extend?"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:45:00.000Z","text":"how does extend work"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:45:00.000Z","text":"what does it tell the environment to do"},{"user":"Michael Bird","date":"2011-11-22T06:47:00.000Z","text":"do you think that knowing that would change anything? i don't think that brings you opportunity like knowing about header files or APIs because you can use knowledge of those to make code robust"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:47:00.000Z","text":"i agree dude, that was just curiosity"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:48:00.000Z","text":"i feel like i'll be better equipped to tackle more problems if i knew how those kinds of things worked"},{"user":"Michael Bird","date":"2011-11-22T06:50:00.000Z","text":"more about what they do and how they are used, knowing what extend tells the environment to do can't better equip you, can it?"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:51:00.000Z","text":"not at all, not better"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:51:00.000Z","text":"just maybe marginally i guess"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:51:00.000Z","text":"maybe you're right dude!"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:51:00.000Z","text":"but i'm just curious"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:51:00.000Z","text":"i'm like this in math, but there it's easier"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:52:00.000Z","text":"in this field, there's too much"},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2011-11-22T06:52:00.000Z","text":"people actually specify

collecting dust and giving home to many cobwebs. What happened? How have I fallen so far from myself that I can’t compose an intelligible sentence these days? Nothing feels the same, no one looks the same and I am not the same as I once was. I’m trapped in an alternative universe, spiraling in this constant vortex of disappointment, and this version of me is one I’ve tried burying for years. I hoped it would never come to this; to the point where it’s become such a tedious task for me to even get the motivation to type words, even write them on paper. Where did the days go when I could just sit back and everything flowed effortlessly together into beautiful pieces of art? I’ve never felt so lost from the real me in any of my 18 years of existence. Flowers don’t have the same pure aroma, colors aren’t as vibrant, people seem the exact opposite of genuine…And my heart just doesn’t feel right. It’s like trying to force a puzzle piece into a spot you know is completely wrong just because you want to finish the game. Everything seems like a pointless task and I can’t find any enjoyment in life anymore.\""},{"user":"Michael Bird","date":"2012-01-24T21:47:00.000Z","text":"you are amazing"},{"user":"Michael

Lately, everything’s just jumbled up in every corner of my pantry, collecting dust even. My cooking used to be my escape from the world, my own little sanctuary. What happened? How have I fallen so far from my cookbook that I can’t even concoct an edible dish these days? Nothing tastes the same, nothing looks the same, and I am not the same cook I was. I feel trapped in a mexican body and this version of me has fried burritos for years. I never wished it would come to this. To the point where it’s become such a tedious task for me to even get the motivation to put sauce to noodle. Where did the days go when I could just sit back and everything flowed effortlessly together like beautiful layers of lasagna? I’ve never felt so far from the recipe before in any of my 19 years of experience. Sauces don’t have the same aroma, colors aren’t as vibrant, tomatoes seem the opposite of fresh…And my bologna doesn’t feel right. It’s like trying to force an ingredient into a pot you know is completely wrong just because you want to finish the dish. Everything seems like a pointless task and I can’t find any enjoyment in cooking anymore. Maybe it’s just a phase…Like a chef’s block if you will. \n\nle Sigh..."},{"user":"David Perlaza","date":"2013-06-12T19:46:00.000Z","text":"Oh yeah lol.

You could probably write ultipro in C but fuck that. So I see genetics the same way. I can play basketball as a 5'2 basketball player but there people better built for that sport. So just like you only see certain language in very particular domains, you'll see that people of a certain genetic would probably be predisposed to experience similar things.

When we ask “what is the value of the infinite sum,” we've made a mistake before we even answer!  Infinite sums don't have values until we assign them a value, and there are different protocols for doing that.  We should be asking not what IS the value, but what should we define the value to be?  There are different protocols, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  The protocol you learn in calculus class, involving limits, would decline to assign any value at all to the sum in the video.  A different protocol assigns it the value -1/12.  Neither answer is more correct than the other.\""},{"user":"Michael Bird","date":"2014-02-21T14:57:00.000Z","text":"Ahh that is so deflating!
